## Disk-Based Merge Sort

#### Goal 
To compare the performance of different algorithms for creating and merging runs during merge sort.

#### Merge Sort Methods
- Basic
- Multistep
- Replacement

#### Available Memory Constraint
The program assumes that the input buffer and output buffers are sized to hold a maximum of 1000 integer keys.

#### Program Execution

`
cc main.c
`

`
./a.out mergeSortMethod indexFile sortedIndexFile
`

Example: 

`./a.out --multistep input.bin sort.bin`
